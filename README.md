HITWICKET software engineer task
It is a command line interface chess game coded using java. As pawns are the main soldiers in the chess game, pawns are coded first to meet level 1 eligibility. THere is no king and queen in this game. Two users are playing in the grid where the Winner is chosen by the player who deafeats all the characters of other player.
I created this using Java with the intention of furthering my understanding of OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism.It is played with move, capture, and pawn promotion functionality for all pieces as well as player scores, checkmate.

HOW TO INSTALL:
Following are the commands should be entered in Command Line interface.
 git clone https://github.com/Nagendran956/SD_2022_19BEC1042.git
 cd Chess
 javac play.java
 java play
 
HOW TO PLAY:
Each player can arrange their characters on their end in any order. They will have 5 pawns to start with and will need to deploy all of them at the start of the game.
The input for initial character positions will be taken as a list of character names, placing them from left to right on the starting lanes. Once this process is complete for both the players, they can start making moves.
The application then takes move inputs from the players, alternating between the players, updating the game state in the process.
